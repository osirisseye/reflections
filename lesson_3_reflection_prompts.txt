When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Keep locally files that you currently work on. Separate working/public code from the code you have to work on.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Able to see how big of a change is there since the last pull request. Given no changes on the original GitHub repo - it will be easier to solve any conflicts.
